The project's main objective is to predict the winner of the La Liga league for the 2023/2024 season and provide insights into the league and the teams involved, namely Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. To achieve this objective, a simple weighted score model was developed in Excel, which is based on five key areas of analysis: Seasonal Analysis, Home and Away Analysis, Form Analysis, Squad Depth Analysis, and Head to head-to-head analysis. By aggregating the scores obtained from each of these areas, the team with the highest total weighted score will be predicted to win the league for the 2023/2024 season
